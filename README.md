# Primors

Package library for common React functionalities.

## Development

### Getting started

To install all dependencies, run:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Local development

To build the functionalities locally, run:

```sh
yarn build
```

To run the Storybook app locally, which listens for changes and hotreloads, run:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

You can also build a production build of the Storybook app locally by running:

```sh
yarn build-storybook
```

### Publishing

To build and deploy a new version of the package, run:

```sh
yarn version
yarn publish
```

`yarn version` automatically generates a new changelog in `CHANGELOG.md` based on all commits since last release, and bumps the version of the package in `package.json` and tags the release.

### Linting

To lint the project, I suggest installing the ESLint plugin in your editor, but to run it from terminal, run:

```sh
yarn lint
```

## Technology

This library is built using:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

For development, these comfort-packages are used:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
