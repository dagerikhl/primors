Package library for common React functionalities.

## Live documentation

Storybook docs deployed on GH Pages: [https://dagerikhl.github.io/primors](https://dagerikhl.github.io/primors)

## Development

### Getting started

To install all dependencies, run:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Local development

To build the functionalities locally, run:

```sh
yarn build
```

To run the Storybook app locally, which listens for changes and hotreloads, run:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

You can also build a production build of the Storybook app locally by running:

```sh
yarn build-storybook
```

### Publishing npm package

To build and publish a new version of the package, run:

```sh
yarn version
yarn publish
```

`yarn version` automatically generates a new changelog in `CHANGELOG.md` based on all commits since last release, and bumps the version of the package in `package.json` and tags the release.

`yarn publish` deploys a new version to the NPM package registry.

### Deploying Storybook app

To build and deploy the Storybook live documentation app, run:

```sh
yarn deploy-storybook
```

#### Commit format

This project uses auto-changelog to automatically generate a changelog. You can use several prefixes in your commit messages to categorize commits in your changelog:

- `Feat(ure)?:`: New features, _for the library_. Changes to the Storybook app should be categorized under "Performance".
- `Fix:`: Bug fixes.
- `Impr?(ovement)?:`: General improvements.
- `Perf(ormance)?:`: Performance improvements.
- `Doc(umentation|s)?:`: Changes to documentation, e.g. `README.md` or the Storybook app.
- `Build:`: Changes to the build or deploy environments.
- `Conf(ig)?(uration)?:`: Changes to project configuration.
- Any commits not matching one of these patterns will not be categorized.

##### Breaking changes

You can mark any commit as a breaking change by writing "BREAKING CHANGE" anywhere in your commit message.

### Linting

To lint the project, I suggest installing the ESLint plugin in your editor, but to run it from terminal, run:

```sh
yarn lint
```
